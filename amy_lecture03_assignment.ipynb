    "## Question 1: Creating a Retirement Savings Calculator\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python program (retirement_calculator.py) that calculates the total amount of money a person will have saved by the time they reach retirement age. The calculation should take into account their monthly earnings and monthly spending. The program should be divided into sub-functions to handle specific parts of the calculation. Additionally, the program should accept the necessary input values (current age, retirement age, monthly earnings, and monthly spending) via command-line arguments using sys.argv. (in total 20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Sub-Function 1: calculate_annual_earnings__\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Write a function named calculate_annual_earnings that takes one parameter: monthly_earnings.\n",
    "    - The function should return the total earnings for the year.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Sub-Function 2: calculate_annual_spending__\n",
    "    - Write a function named calculate_annual_spending that takes one parameter: monthly_spending.\n",
    "    - The function should return the total spending for the year.\n",
    "    (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Sub-Function 3: calculate_net_savings__\n",
    "    - Write a function named calculate_net_savings that takes two parameters: annual_earnings and annual_spending.\n",
    "    - The function should return the net savings for the year.\n",
    "    (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Main Function: calculate_retirement_savings__\n",
    "    - Write a main function named calculate_retirement_savings that takes four parameters: current_age, retirement_age, monthly_earnings, and monthly_spending.\n",
    "    - The function should:\n",
    "        1. Calculate the number of years until retirement.\n",
    "        2. Use the calculate_annual_earnings function to determine the annual earnings.\n",
    "        3. Use the calculate_annual_spending function to determine the annual spending.\n",
    "        4. Use the calculate_net_savings function to determine the net savings for each year.\n",
    "        5. Calculate the net savings by the number of years until retirement to get the total savings by retirement age.\n",
    "    - The function should return the total savings by the time the person retires.\n",
    "    (4 points)\n",
    "5. __Command-Line Argument Handling:__\n",
    "    - Import the sys module to handle command-line arguments.\n",
    "    - Modify the program to retrieve the following inputs from sys.argv:\n",
    "        1. current_age: The current age of the person.\n",
    "        2. retirement_age: The age at which the person plans to retire.\n",
    "        3. monthly_earnings: The amount the person earns per month.\n",
    "        4. monthly_spending: The amount the person spends per month.\n",
    "    - Ensure that the program correctly parses the input values as integers or floats as needed.\n",
    "    (4 points)"
